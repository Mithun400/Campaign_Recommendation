# Models for the Campaign Recommendation

In this repo, a [logistic regression framework](https://github.com/Mithun400/Campaign_Recommendation/blob/main/fl_model.py) has been developed for the Front Loading prediction, a [linear regreassion model](https://github.com/Mithun400/Campaign_Recommendation/blob/main/fc_model.py) has been developed for the Frequency Cap prediction and a [Collaborative Filtering model](https://github.com/Mithun400/Campaign_Recommendation/blob/main/cf_model.py)(CF) has been developed for the targeting tactic recommendation. A [note book](https://github.com/Mithun400/Campaign_Recommendation/blob/main/targeting_tactic_KT_BT.ipynb) for the CF has also been attached here.
